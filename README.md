# RainingInLondon

## Is it raining in London, that is the question.

This project is using the free DataPoint API (thanks Met Office!)

It creates a web server and responds with weather information for London. 

The features implemented so far include:
- Loading weather codes from a YAML file
- Requesting a JSON every 5 minutes from Met Office
- Displaying the latest weather info on the screen
